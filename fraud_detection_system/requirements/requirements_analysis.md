### Task 2.2: Functional and Non-Functional Requirements

#### Functional Requirements

1.  **Fraud Detection Accuracy**: The system must correctly identify fraudulent transactions (true positives) while minimizing false positives.
2.  **Real-time Notification**: Customers should be notified about fraudulent transactions in real-time or as soon as possible after detection.
3.  **Transaction Approval**: In cases of uncertain transaction legitimacy, the system should prompt for transaction approval.
4.  **Data Analysis Capability**: The system must analyze transaction data to detect patterns indicative of fraud.
5.  **Automatic Transaction Handling**: Upon detection of a fraudulent transaction, the system should automatically take necessary actions like blocking the transaction or notifying the customer.

#### Non-Functional Requirements

1.  **System Latency**: The fraud detection system should operate with minimal latency to ensure real-time monitoring and prevention.
2.  **Scalability**: The system must handle a growing volume of transactions without degradation in performance.
3.  **Security and Compliance**: Adherence to legal regulations regarding the protection of personally identifiable information and financial data.
4.  **User Interface**: The system should provide a user-friendly interface for both customers and bank staff.
5.  **Interoperability**: The system must seamlessly integrate with existing banking systems and infrastructure.

### Task 2.3: Analysis and Prioritization of Requirements

The prioritization of these requirements is based on the impact on customer trust and satisfaction, regulatory compliance, and operational efficiency.

1.  **Fraud Detection Accuracy** is critical because it directly impacts financial losses and customer trust.
2.  **Security and Compliance** are non-negotiable due to legal and ethical obligations.
3.  **System Latency** is essential for the effectiveness of real-time fraud detection.
4.  **Real-time Notification** enhances customer service and fraud mitigation.
5.  **Scalability** ensures that as SecureBank grows, the system remains effective.
