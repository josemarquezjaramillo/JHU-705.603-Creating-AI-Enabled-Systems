# Task 1.1
* Stakeholder 1: Chief Executive Officer (CEO) 
  * The CEO is named personally in the problem statement. By a general definition of a CEO, she is
  responsible for the overall strategy and performance of SecureBank. Improving the fraud detection system directly 
  impacts the profitability and reputation of the bank. 
  * A possible strategy for engagement could include the scheduling of recurring meeting during the development and 
  deployment process to report findings and progres. Since he is not likely to be a technical person, it would be 
  important to explain the model in business terms using visual aids like graphs or schematics to demonstrate 
  performance improvements. The project should also be laid out using timelines and milestones which should align with the overall company strategy.
* Stakeholder 2: Chief RiskOfficer (CRO)
  * The CRO reports to the CEO and is responsible for managing risk across the bank. This includes financial, 
  operational, and reputational risk. Fraud detection falls right into the intersection of these types of risks. 
  Improving the bank's ability to detect fraud will significantly improve risk mitigation on all these three risk types.
  * As the CEO will help align the development of the project with the overall business strategy, the domain expertise 
  of the CRO will help align the project with the way in which the bank defines, detects, and mitigates fraud. It would
  then be important to collaborate closely to understand the specific risk metrics and thresholds, provide detailed 
  reports on model performance and false positive/negatives. The CRO should also be involved in the model validation 
  process to ensure the system meets risk management standards.
  
# Task 1.2
* Stakeholder 1: CEO
  * Functional Requirement: What specific outcomes (specific metrics) do you expect to be improved by the use of this 
  machine learning model? What would you consider successful improvement in these metrics?
  * Non-Functional Requirement: Do you expect this model to be used in other types of transactions or business functions? If so, What are your medium to long term expectations for the scalability and adaptability of the model?
* Stakeholder 2: CRO 
  * Functional Requirement: What criteria do you currently use to determine that a transaction is fraudulent? To that end, what are some specific metrics that you track in terms of transaction fraud and how are those defined?
  * Non-functional requirement: How do you currently balance the tradeoff between minimizing false positives and false negatives in your current mechanism for detecting fraud? How would you expect this tradeoff to be handled in the future?
