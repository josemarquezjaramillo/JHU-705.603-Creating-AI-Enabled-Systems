### Task 3.1: Requirements List with Explanation and Technologies

#### Functional Requirements:

1.  **Fraud Detection Accuracy**: Implement machine learning algorithms that continually learn from transaction data to improve accuracy. Use ensemble methods like Random Forest or Boosted Trees to enhance prediction performance.
2.  **Real-time Notification**: Utilize push notifications through mobile banking apps and SMS to alert customers immediately when potential fraud is detected.
3.  **Transaction Approval**: Implement a rule-based system that triggers additional verification steps for transactions that the system flags as suspicious but is uncertain about.
4.  **Data Analysis Capability**: Use big data analytics tools like Apache Hadoop for processing large volumes of data and Apache Spark for real-time data processing.
5.  **Automatic Transaction Handling**: Develop a workflow automation system that integrates with the bankâ€™s transaction processing system to block or flag fraudulent transactions instantly.

#### Non-Functional Requirements:

1.  **System Latency**: Optimize the fraud detection algorithms and infrastructure using in-memory computing solutions like SAP HANA to reduce latency.
2.  **Scalability**: Design the system architecture using microservices to ensure it can scale out efficiently as transaction volumes grow.
3.  **Security and Compliance**: Implement robust data encryption and access control mechanisms. Regular audits and compliance checks should be scheduled.
4.  **User Interface**: Design an intuitive dashboard for analysts and customers, ensuring it is accessible on multiple devices and platforms.
5.  **Interoperability**: Use standard API protocols for integration with other banking systems, ensuring smooth data flow and system functionality.
