    "### Finding 1: **Variation in Lighting Conditions**\n",
    "#### Impact on Model Performance:\n",
    "Lighting conditions can significantly affect the appearance of human faces in images. Variations in lighting can change the way features are captured, leading to potential inconsistencies in the embeddings generated by the model. Faces under different lighting conditions might not be easily recognized as the same person by the model, impacting the identification accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Detailed Analysis:\n",
    "1. **Preprocessing and Data Augmentation**:\n",
    "   - To mitigate this, data augmentation techniques can be used during training to simulate different lighting conditions. Techniques such as brightness adjustment, contrast variation, and adding shadows can help the model learn to recognize faces under various lighting conditions.\n",
    "   - Standardizing lighting during preprocessing can also help. Techniques like histogram equalization can normalize lighting across images.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Evaluation Metrics**:\n",
    "   - The model's performance should be evaluated on a test set that includes a wide range of lighting conditions. This ensures that the model is robust to lighting variations.\n",
    "   - Metrics to measure: Identification accuracy under different lighting conditions, precision, recall, and F1-score.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Impact on KD-Tree Search**:\n",
    "   - Variations in lighting can affect the embedding space, making similar faces appear distant in the embedding space. This can reduce the effectiveness of KD-Tree search, as it relies on the proximity of embeddings.\n",
    "   - Analysis should include measuring the retrieval accuracy of the KD-Tree under different lighting conditions to ensure it maintains high performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding 2: **Presence of Facial Occlusions (e.g., Glasses, Masks, Hair)**\n",
    "#### Impact on Model Performance:\n",
    "Facial occlusions, such as glasses, masks, or hair covering parts of the face, can obscure important features that the model relies on for identification. This can lead to incorrect embeddings and misidentifications, especially in scenarios where the occlusions are significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Detailed Analysis:\n",
    "1. **Preprocessing and Data Augmentation**:\n",
    "   - Augmentation techniques can be used to include synthetic occlusions in the training data. This helps the model learn to ignore or appropriately handle occlusions during feature extraction.\n",
    "   - Techniques such as random erasing, where parts of the image are randomly occluded during training, can help the model become robust to occlusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Evaluation Metrics**:\n",
    "   - The test set should include images with various types of occlusions to evaluate the model's robustness. This will provide a clear understanding of how well the model handles real-world scenarios.\n",
    "   - Metrics to measure: Identification accuracy with occluded faces, precision, recall, and F1-score.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Impact on KD-Tree Search**:\n",
    "   - Occlusions can lead to embedding distortions, causing embeddings of the same person to be scattered in the embedding space. This can reduce the effectiveness of nearest neighbor search in the KD-Tree.\n",
    "   - Analyzing the retrieval accuracy and consistency of the KD-Tree with occluded faces is crucial. Techniques like embedding regularization or using additional contextual information can be explored to improve robustness."
